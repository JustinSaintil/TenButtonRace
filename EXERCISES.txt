These exercises do not go in any particular order. Complete them whenever you know
the skills necessary. Occasionally they may require a minor skill that was not taught
directly in the lessons. You may be able to infer it, or you may have to search the
internet or ask for help.

The basic task is stated right away, and ideas to enhance it are listed afterward.


--------------------------------------
#1. Write a graphical version of the height converter program. Use text boxes for
feet and inches, and a StaticText for centimeters.

A. Update the output as the user types input with no submit button by using an 
EVT_TEXT event (http://docs.wxwidgets.org/trunk/classwx_text_ctrl.html)

B. Include a checkbox labeled "round the answer" to only display a few decimal places.

C. Allow the program to convert from English to SI units or the other way around.




--------------------------------------
#2. Create a simple TicTacToe game where players take turns clicking where the X and
O should go.

A. Make the program detect when one player has won the game.

B. Make the player keep track of how many wins.
(eg. a xw.StaticText saying "player 1: 4 wins    player 2: 17 wins")

C. Allow the users to enter names and the win counter to refer to them by name.

D. Allow the users to choose images as their markers instead of just X and O.

E. Create one player mode where the human plays against the computer.

--------------------------------------
For more practice, recreate any of the terminal-based programs you wrote as GUI programs.
